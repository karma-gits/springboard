# :camera: :mag_right: **Automatic Safety Gear Detection Model in Construction Setting Capstone Project** :mag:
The improper wearing of safety gear in industrial construction environments is a common issue, posing a significant risk to worker safety and compliance. Despite the importance of safety gear, many workers fail to wear it properly, putting themselves and others at risk. This problem is particularly prevalent in industries where safety gear is not always mandatory, such as construction sites.

# :headphones: :iphone: :computer: Product Recommendation System Capstone Project
Many e-commerce companies encounter difficulties in
delivering personalized product recommendations to customers,
leading to decreased engagement and missed sales opportunities.
A successful recommendation system, powered by machine
learning algorithms and customer data, is crucial for enhancing
user engagement, improving user satisfaction, and driving sales
growth. The goal of this project is to develop and deploy a
tailored recommendation system within six months, with the
aim of achieving a 5%-10% sales increase within a year through
continuous optimization
