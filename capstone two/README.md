# Product Recommendation System Capstone Project

Many e-commerce companies encounter difficulties in
delivering personalized product recommendations to customers,
leading to decreased engagement and missed sales opportunities.
A successful recommendation system, powered by machine
learning algorithms and customer data, is crucial for enhancing
user engagement, improving user satisfaction, and driving sales
growth. The goal of this project is to develop and deploy a
tailored recommendation system within six months, with the
aim of achieving a 5%-10% sales increase within a year through
continuous optimization
