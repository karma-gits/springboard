# **Automatic Safety Gear Detection Model in Construction Setting Capstone Project**
The improper wearing of safety gear in industrial construction environments is a common issue, posing a significant risk to worker safety and compliance. Despite the importance of safety gear, many workers fail to wear it properly, putting themselves and others at risk. This problem is particularly prevalent in industries where safety gear is not always mandatory, such as construction sites.

## Demo: Works on live camera, stock videos and images

## Steps:
- **Images** - gather from the internet
- **RoboFlow** - to annotate the dataset for object detection.
